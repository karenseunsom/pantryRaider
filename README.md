# Pantry Raider

Pantry Raider is a full stack web app built to help people figure out what to whip up in the kitchen with ingredients sitting in their pantry. The app uses a back-end server and database to allow users to create an account with Pantry Raider and keep track of their favorites dishes. All dishes have the option to view the recipe which will show the ingredients needed, instructions, and estimated ready time.

# Motivation

Our teammate, Joey, is a longtime professional chef. Along with searching 3rd party dishes, we thought it would be neat to showcase some of his favorite dishes.

# Features

- Home page cannot be accessed without having an account
- User information and user favorites stored in PostgresSQL database
- Seeder files used to have everybody easily update and pull current database
- CheckAuth?
- EJS as view engine
- Flash messages to show if an entered email does not exist in database or if an email is correct, but the password is incorrect

# How to use

Begin by navigating to Pantry Raider. There will be an option to sign up, if you do not have an account yet. Once you log in, you should be redirected to the home page. Here you can enter an ingredient or ingredients into the serach bar to relevant recipes. Many dishes should pop up, where you can either view the receipe or add the dish to your favorites.
